The '''Moon''' is the only [[natural satellite]] of [[Earth]]. It [[Orbit of the Moon|orbits]] around Earth at an average [[Lunar distance|distance of]] {{convert|384399|km|mi}},{{efn|Because the Moon follows an elliptical path, its distance from Earth varies over the year, ranging from {{convert|357000|-|407000|km|mi}}.<ref name="NASAfactsheet">{{cite web |title=Moon Fact Sheet |url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/moonfact.html |website=NASA National Space Science Data Center |publisher=NASA |date=2024-01-11 |access-date=2025-08-06 |archive-date=April 2, 2019 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190402143754/https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/moonfact.html |url-status=dead }}</ref>}} a distance roughly 30 times the [[Earth diameter|width of Earth]]. It [[orbital period|completes an orbit]] ([[lunar month]]) in relation to Earth and the Sun ([[lunation|synodically]]) every 29.5 days. The Moon and Earth are bound by [[gravity|gravitational]] attraction, which is stronger on the sides facing each other. The resulting [[tidal force]]s are the main driver of Earth's [[tide]]s, and have pulled the Moon to always face Earth with the same [[Near side of the Moon|near side]]. This [[tidal locking]] effectively synchronizes the Moon's [[Rotation period (astronomy)|rotation period]] ([[lunar day]]) to its orbital period (lunar month).

In [[geophysical definition of planet|geophysical terms]], the Moon is a [[planetary-mass object]] or [[satellite planet]]. Its mass is 1.2% that of the Earth, and its diameter is {{cvt|3474|km|mi}}, roughly one-quarter of Earth's (about as wide as the [[contiguous United States]]). Within the [[Solar System]], it is [[List of Solar System objects by size|larger and more massive]] than any known [[dwarf planet]], and the fifth-largest and fifth-most massive moon, as well as the largest and most massive in relation to its [[primary body|parent planet]].<ref name="Metzger2021"/> Its [[surface gravity]] is about one-sixth of Earth's, about half that of [[Mars]], and the second-highest among all moons in the Solar System after [[Jupiter]]'s moon [[Io (moon)|Io]]. The body of the Moon is [[planetary differentiation|differentiated]] and [[Terrestrial planet|terrestrial]], with only a minuscule [[hydrosphere]], [[Atmosphere of the Moon|atmosphere]], and [[Magnetic field of the Moon|magnetic field]]. The [[lunar surface]] is covered in [[lunar regolith|regolith dust]], which mainly consists of the fine [[Ejecta blanket|material ejected]] from the [[lunar crust]] by [[impact event]]s. The lunar crust is marked by [[impact crater]]s, with some younger ones featuring bright [[Ray system|ray-like streaks]]. The Moon was volcanically active until 1.2 billion years ago, surfacing lava mostly on the thinner near side of the Moon, filling ancient craters, which through cooling formed the today prominently visible dark plains of [[basalt]] called [[lunar mare|maria]] ('seas'). The [[origin of the Moon]] is not clear, although it has been hypothesized to have formed out of material from Earth, ejected by [[giant-impact hypothesis|a giant impact]] into Earth of a Mars-sized body named [[Theia (planet)|Theia]] 4.51&nbsp;billion years ago, not long after [[Age of Earth|Earth's formation]].

From a distance, the day and night phases of the lunar day are visible as the [[lunar phases]], and when the Moon passes through [[Earth's shadow]] a [[lunar eclipse]] is observable. The Moon's [[apparent size]] in Earth's sky is about the same as that of the Sun, which causes it to cover the Sun completely during a total [[solar eclipse]]. The Moon is the [[List of brightest natural objects in the sky|brightest celestial object]] in Earth's [[night sky]] because of its large apparent size, while the [[reflectance]] (albedo) of its surface is comparable to that of [[asphalt concrete|asphalt]]. About 59% of the surface of the Moon is visible from Earth owing to the different angles at which the Moon can appear in Earth's sky ([[libration]]), making parts of the [[far side of the Moon]] visible.

The Moon has been an important source of inspiration and knowledge in human history, having been crucial to [[cosmography]], [[mythology]], [[Lunar deity|religion]], art, [[Lunar calendar|time keeping]], [[natural science]] and [[spaceflight]]. The [[Timeline of Solar System exploration|first spaceflights]] to an extraterrestrial body were to the Moon, starting in 1959 with the [[Flyby (spaceflight)|flyby]] of ''[[Luna 1]]'' (sent by the [[Soviet Union]]), and the [[Impactor (spacecraft)|intentional impact]] of ''[[Luna 2]]'', followed in 1966 by the first [[soft landing]] (by ''[[Luna 9]]'') and [[orbital insertion]] (by ''[[Luna 10]]''). Humans first arrived in orbit on December 24, 1968, with [[Apollo 8]] (sent by the [[United States]]), and then on the surface on July 20, 1969, with [[Apollo 11]]. By 1972, six Apollo missions had landed twelve humans on the Moon and stayed up to three days. Renewed robotic [[exploration of the Moon]], in particular to confirm the presence of [[water on the Moon]], has fueled plans to return humans to the Moon, starting with the [[Artemis program]] scheduled for the late 2020s.

== Names and etymology ==
The English proper name for Earth's natural satellite is typically written as ''Moon'', with a capital ''M''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iau.org/public_press/themes/naming/#spelling |title=Naming Astronomical Objects: Spelling of Names |publisher=[[International Astronomical Union]] |access-date=April 6, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216024716/http://www.iau.org/public_press/themes/naming/#spelling |archive-date=December 16, 2008}}</ref><ref name="PN-FAQ" /> The noun ''moon'' is derived from [[Old English]] {{lang|ang|mōna}}, which stems from {{proto|germanic|mēnōn}},<ref>{{cite book |first=Vladimir |last=Orel |year=2003 |url=https://archive.org/details/Orel-AHandbookOfGermanicEtymology/mode/2up/search/moon |title=A Handbook of Germanic Etymology |publisher=Brill |access-date=March 5, 2020}}</ref> which in turn comes from [[Proto-Indo-European]] {{lang|ine-x-proto|mēnsis}} ('month')<ref>{{cite dictionary |entry=*mēnsis |first=Fernando |last=López-Menchero |title=Proto-Indo-European dictionary-translator |url=https://indo-european.info/dictionary-translator/word.inc.php/ine/m%c4%93nsis |dictionary=Late Proto-Indo-European Etymological Lexicon |date=May 22, 2020 |access-date=July 30, 2022 |archive-date=May 22, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200522153418/https://indo-european.info/dictionary-translator/word.inc.php/ine/m%c4%93nsis |url-status=live}}</ref>{{snd}}from earlier {{lang|ine-x-proto|mēnōt}} (genitive {{lang|ine-x-proto|mēneses}}), which may be related to a verb meaning 'to measure [time]'.<ref name="barnhart1995" />

The Latin name for the Moon is {{lang|la|lūna}}. The English adjective ''lunar'' was ultimately borrowed from Latin, likely through French. In scientific writing and science fiction, the Moon is sometimes referred to as ''Luna'' {{IPAc-en|'|l|uː|n|ə}}<ref>For example: {{cite book |first=James A. |last=Hall III |date=2016 |title=Moons of the Solar System |publisher=Springer |isbn=978-3-319-20636-3}}</ref> to distinguish it from other moons. In poetry, ''Luna'' may also refer to the [[personification]] of the Moon as a woman.<ref name="OEDLuna">{{OED|Luna}}</ref>

The Ancient Greek word {{tlit|grc|selḗnē}} referred to the Moon as a celestial body, and also to the moon goddess [[Selene]] {{IPAc-en|s|ə|ˈ|l|iː|n|iː}}. The rare English adjective ''selenian'' {{IPAc-en|s|ə|l|iː|n|i|ə|n}}<ref>{{MW|selenian}}</ref> is used to describe the Moon as a world, as opposed to a celestial object.<ref>{{OED|selenian}}</ref> Its cognate ''selenic'', originally a rare synonym,<ref>{{OED|selenic}}</ref> now almost always refers to the chemical element [[selenium]].<ref>{{MW|selenic}}</ref> The corresponding prefix ''seleno-'' appears in terms including ''[[selenography]]'' (the study of the lunar surface).<ref name="oed" /><ref>{{LSJ|selh/nh |σελήνη |ref}}.</ref>

[[Artemis]], the Greek goddess of the wilderness and the hunt, also came to be identified with Selene, and was sometimes called [[Cynthia]] after her birthplace on [[Mount Cynthus]].<ref name="Pannen2010">{{cite book |first=Imke |last=Pannen |title=When the Bad Bleeds: Mantic Elements in English Renaissance Revenge Tragedy |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=37CPbHwqPjwC&pg=PA96 |year=2010 |publisher=V&R |isbn=978-3-89971-640-5 |page=96}}</ref> Her Roman equivalent is [[Diana (mythology)|Diana]].

=== Lunar geologic timescale ===
{{main|Lunar geologic timescale}}
{{Timeline Lunar Geological Timescale}}

The lunar geological periods are named after their characteristic features, from most [[impact crater]]s outside the dark [[Lunar mare|mare]], to the mare and later craters, and finally the young, still bright and therefore readily visible craters with [[ray system]]s like [[Copernicus (lunar crater)|Copernicus]] or [[Tycho (lunar crater)|Tycho]].

=== Future ===
{{see also|Destruction of the Moon}}
In 5 billion years the Moon will have wandered 40% further away from Earth than it is now. However at a similar time the Sun will have become a [[red giant]]. Assuming the Sun envelopes the Earth-Moon system, the consequent drag from the Sun's atmosphere may cause the orbital distance between the Earth and the Moon to decay to the point where the Moon comes within the Earth's [[Roche limit]], leading it to disintegrate.<ref name="f170">{{cite web | last=Powell | first=David | title=Earth's Moon Destined to Disintegrate | website=Space | date=January 22, 2007 | url=https://www.space.com/3373-earth-moon-destined-disintegrate.html | access-date=September 3, 2025}}</ref>

== Physical characteristics ==
The Moon is a very slightly scalene [[ellipsoid]] due to tidal stretching, with its long axis displaced 30° from facing the Earth, due to gravitational anomalies from impact basins. Its shape is more elongated than current tidal forces can account for. This 'fossil bulge' indicates that the Moon solidified when it orbited at half its current distance to the Earth,<!--at ≈32 Earth radii, currently at 60.3--> and that it is now too cold for its shape to restore [[hydrostatic equilibrium]] at its current orbital distance.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Garrick-Bethell |first1=Ian |last2=Perera |first2=Viranga |last3=Nimmo |first3=Francis |last4=Zuber |first4=Maria T. |year=2014 |title=The tidal-rotational shape of the Moon and evidence for polar wander |url=https://escholarship.org/content/qt0012r6g6/qt0012r6g6.pdf?t=npc7m2 |journal=Nature |volume=512 |issue=7513 |pages=181–184 |doi=10.1038/nature13639 |pmid=25079322 |bibcode=2014Natur.512..181G |s2cid=4452886 |access-date=April 12, 2020 |archive-date=August 4, 2020 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200804071339/https://escholarship.org/content/qt0012r6g6/qt0012r6g6.pdf?t=npc7m2 |url-status=live}}</ref> Today tidal crust deformation is limited to lobate thrust fault scarps formation.<ref name="c293">{{cite web | last=Choi | first=Charles Q. | title=Earth's Gravitational Pull Cracks Open the Moon | website=Space | date=October 12, 2015 | url=https://www.space.com/30795-earth-gravitational-pull-cracks-moon.html | access-date=October 9, 2025}}</ref>

On average the Moon's [[surface gravity]] is {{val|1.62|ul=m/s2}}<ref name="NSSDC" /> ({{val|0.1654|u=[[G-force|g]]}}; {{val|5.318|ul=ft/s2}}), about half of the surface gravity of [[Mars]] and about a sixth of Earth's.

The [[Gravitation of the Moon|Moon's gravitational field]] is not uniform. The details of the gravitational field have been measured through tracking the [[Doppler shift]] of radio signals emitted by orbiting spacecraft. The main lunar gravity features are [[mass concentration (astronomy)|mascons]], large positive gravitational anomalies associated with some of the giant impact basins, partly caused by the dense mare basaltic lava flows that fill those basins.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Muller |first=P. |author2=Sjogren, W. |title=Mascons: lunar mass concentrations |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=161 |pages=680–684 |date=1968 |doi=10.1126/science.161.3842.680 |pmid=17801458 |issue=3842 |bibcode=1968Sci...161..680M |s2cid=40110502}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |author=Richard A.

A permanent [[Moon dust]] cloud exists around the Moon, generated by small particles from comets. 5 tons of comet particles are estimated to strike the Moon's surface every 24 hours, resulting in the ejection of dust particles. The dust stays above the Moon for approximately 10 minutes, taking 5 minutes to rise, and 5 minutes to fall. On average, 120 kilograms of dust are present above the Moon, rising up to 100 kilometers above the surface. Dust counts made by [[LADEE]]'s Lunar Dust EXperiment (LDEX) found particle counts peaked during the [[Geminid]], [[Quadrantid]], [[Taurids|Northern Taurid]], and [[Omicron Centaurids|Omicron Centaurid]] [[meteor shower]]s, when the Earth, and Moon pass through comet debris.

Scientists have confirmed the presence of a cave on the Moon near the [[Sea of Tranquillity]], not far from the 1969 [[Apollo 11]] landing site. The cave, identified as an entry point to a collapsed [[Lunar lava tube|lava tube]], is roughly 45 meters wide and up to 80 m long. This discovery marks the first confirmed entry point to a lunar cave. The analysis was based on photos taken in 2010 by NASA's [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]]. The cave's stable temperature of around {{val|17|u=°C}} could provide a hospitable environment for future astronauts, protecting them from extreme temperatures, solar radiation, and micrometeorites. However, challenges include accessibility and risks of avalanches and cave-ins.

Different episodes of lava flow in maria can often be recognized by variations in surface albedo and distinct flow margins.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Friedman |first1=R. C. |last2=Blewett |first2=D.

[[File:Lava flows in Mare Imbrium (AS15-M-1558).png|thumb|Old [[basalt|hardened]] lava flows of [[Mare Imbrium]] forming [[wrinkle ridge]]s]]

As the maria formed, cooling and contraction of the basaltic lava created [[wrinkle ridge]]s in some areas. These low, sinuous ridges can extend for hundreds of kilometers and often outline buried structures within the mare. Another result of maria formation is the creation of concentric depressions along the edges, known as [[rille|arcuate rilles]]. These features occur as the mare basalts sink inward under their own weight, causing the edges to fracture and separate.

In addition to the visible maria, the Moon has mare deposits covered by ejecta from impacts. Called cryptomares, these hidden mares are likely older than the exposed ones.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Izquierdo |first1=Kristel |last2=Sori |first2=M.

Impact melts are formed when intense shock pressures from collisions vaporize and melt zones around the impact site. Where still exposed, impact melt can be distinguished from mare lava by its distribution, albedo, and texture.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Spudis |first1=Paul |year=2016 |title=Mapping Melts on the Moon |journal=Smithsonian Air and Space Magazine |url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/air-space-magazine/mapping-melted-moon-180958645/}}</ref>

[[Sinuous rilles]], found in and around maria, are likely extinct [[lava channels]] or collapsed [[lava tubes]]. They typically originate from volcanic [[Volcanism on the Moon|vents]], meandering and sometimes branching as they progress. The largest examples, such as [[Schroter's Valley]] and [[Hadley–Apennine|Rima Hadley]], are significantly longer, wider, and deeper than terrestrial lava channels, sometimes featuring bends and sharp turns that again, are uncommon on Earth.

Mare volcanism has altered impact craters in various ways, including filling them to varying degrees, and raising and fracturing their floors from uplift of mare material beneath their interiors. Examples of such craters include [[Taruntius (crater)|Taruntius]] and [[Gassendi (crater)|Gassendi]]. Some craters, such as [[Hyginus (crater)|Hyginus]], are of wholly volcanic origin, forming as [[caldera]]s or [[pit crater|collapse pits]]. Such craters are relatively rare and tend to be smaller (typically a few kilometers wide), shallower, and more irregularly shaped than impact craters. They also lack the upturned rims characteristic of impact craters.

Several [[geologic province]]s containing [[shield volcano]]es and volcanic [[lunar dome|domes]] are found within the near side maria.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Wilson |first1=Lionel |last2=Head |first2=James W. |title=Lunar Gruithuisen and Mairan domes: Rheology and mode of emplacement |journal=[[Journal of Geophysical Research]] |date=2003 |volume=108 |url=http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2003/2002JE001909.shtml |access-date=April 12, 2007 |issue=E2 |doi=10.1029/2002JE001909 |page=5012 |bibcode=2003JGRE..108.5012W |citeseerx=10.1.1.654.9619 |s2cid=14917901 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070312071105/http://www.agu.org/pubs/crossref/2003/2002JE001909.shtml |archive-date=March 12, 2007}}</ref> There are also some regions of [[pyroclastic rock|pyroclastic deposits]], [[scoria cones]] and [[volcanism on the Moon|non-basaltic domes]] made of particularly high viscosity lava.

A major geologic process that has affected the Moon's surface is [[impact crater]]ing,<ref>{{cite book |last=Melosh |first=H. J. |title=Impact cratering: A geologic process |date=1989 |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |isbn=978-0-19-504284-9}}</ref> with craters formed when asteroids and comets collide with the lunar surface.

In order of increasing diameter, the basic types are simple craters with smooth bowl shaped interiors and upturned rims, [[complex crater]]s with flat floors, terraced walls and central peaks, [[peak ring]] basins, and [[multi-ring basin]]s with two or more concentric rings of peaks.<ref>[https://www.lpi.usra.edu/exploration/education/hsResearch/moon_101/ImpactCratering.pdf Impact Cratering Notes (LPI)]</ref> The vast majority of impact craters are circular, but some, like [[Cantor (crater)|Cantor]] and [[Janssen (lunar crater)|Janssen]], have more polygonal outlines, possibly guided by underlying faults and joints. Others, such as the [[Messier (crater)|Messier]] pair, [[Schiller (crater)|Schiller]], and [[Daniell (crater)|Daniell]], are elongated. Such elongation can result from highly oblique impacts, [[binary asteroid]] impacts, fragmentation of impactors before surface strike, or closely spaced [[secondary crater|secondary]] impacts.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Herrick |first1=R.R. |last2=Forsberg-Taylor |first2=N.

The [[lunar geologic timescale]] is based on the most prominent impact events, such as multi-ring formations like [[Nectarian|Nectaris]], [[Lower Imbrian|Imbrium]], and [[Mare Orientale|Orientale]] that are between hundreds and thousands of kilometers in diameter and associated with a broad apron of ejecta deposits that form a regional [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic horizon]].<ref name="geologic" /> The lack of an atmosphere, weather, and recent geological processes mean that many of these craters are well-preserved. Although only a few [[multi-ring basins]] have been definitively dated, they are useful for assigning relative ages. Because impact craters accumulate at a nearly constant rate, counting the number of craters per unit area can be used to estimate the age of the surface.<ref name="geologic" />
However care needs to be exercised with the [[crater counting]] technique due to the potential presence of [[secondary crater]]s. Ejecta from impacts can create secondary craters that often appear in clusters or chains but can also occur as isolated formations at a considerable distance from the impact. These can resemble primary craters, and may even dominate small crater populations, so their unidentified presence can distort age estimates.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Xiao |first1=Z. |last2=Strom |first2=R.G. |year=2012 |title=Problems determining relative and absolute ages using the small crater population |journal=Icarus |volume=220 |issue=1 |pages=254–267 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2012.05.012 |bibcode=2012Icar..220..254X |url=https://www.uni-muenster.de/imperia/md/content/planetology/lectures/ss2015/143897-hottopics/xiao_and_strom_2012.pdf}}</ref>

==== Lunar swirls ====
{{main|Lunar swirls}}
[[File:Reiner-gamma-clem1.jpg|thumb|Wide-angle image of a lunar swirl, the 70-kilometer-long [[Reiner Gamma]]]]
Lunar swirls are enigmatic features found across the Moon's surface. They are characterized by a high albedo, appear optically immature (i.e. have the optical characteristics of a relatively young [[regolith]]), and often have a sinuous shape. Their shape is often accentuated by low [[albedo]] regions that wind between the bright swirls. They are located in places with enhanced surface [[magnetic field]]s and many are located at the [[antipodal point]] of major impacts. Well known swirls include the [[Reiner Gamma]] feature and [[Mare Ingenii]]. They are hypothesized to be areas that have been partially shielded from the [[solar wind]], resulting in slower [[space weathering]].<ref>{{cite journal |title=Reflectance spectra of seven lunar swirls examined by statistical methods: A space weathering study |last1=Chrbolková |first1=Kateřina |last2=Kohout |first2=Tomáš |last3=Ďurech |first3=Josef |journal=Icarus |volume=333 |pages=516–527 |date=November 2019 |doi=10.1016/j.icarus.2019.05.024 |bibcode=2019Icar..333..516C |doi-access=free}}</ref>

=== Presence of water ===
{{main|2 = Lunar water}}

[[File:The image shows the distribution of surface ice at the Moon's south pole (left) and north pole (right).webp|thumb|upright=1.3|Distribution of surface ice at the Moon's South (left) and North poles (right), as viewed by NASA's [[Moon Mineralogy Mapper]] (M<sup>3</sup>) spectrometer onboard India's [[Chandrayaan-1]] orbiter]]

Liquid water cannot persist on the lunar surface. When exposed to solar radiation, water quickly decomposes through a process known as [[photodissociation]] and is lost to space. However, since the 1960s, scientists have hypothesized that water ice may be deposited by impacting [[comets]] or possibly produced by the reaction of oxygen-rich lunar rocks, and hydrogen from [[solar wind]], leaving traces of water which could possibly persist in cold, permanently shadowed craters at either pole on the Moon.<ref name="Margot1999" /><ref>

In years since, signatures of water have been found to exist on the lunar surface.<ref name="moonwater_18032010" /> In 1994, the [[Clementine mission#Bistatic Radar Experiment|bistatic radar experiment]] located on the ''[[Clementine (spacecraft)|Clementine]]'' spacecraft, indicated the existence of small, frozen pockets of water close to the surface. However, later radar observations by [[Arecibo Telescope|Arecibo]], suggest these findings may rather be rocks ejected from young impact craters.<ref>{{cite web |last=Spudis |first=P. |title=Ice on the Moon |url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/740/1 |publisher=[[The Space Review]] |date=November 6, 2006 |access-date=April 12, 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070222083000/http://www.thespacereview.com/article/740/1 |archive-date=February 22, 2007}}</ref> In 1998, the [[Lunar Prospector#Neutron Spectrometer (NS)|neutron spectrometer]] on the ''Lunar Prospector'' spacecraft showed that high concentrations of hydrogen are present in the first meter of depth in the regolith near the polar regions.<ref name="Feldman1998" /> Volcanic lava beads, brought back to Earth aboard Apollo 15, showed small amounts of water in their interior.<ref name="Saal2008" />

The 2008 ''[[Chandrayaan-1]]'' spacecraft has since confirmed the existence of surface water ice, using the on-board [[Moon Mineralogy Mapper]]. The spectrometer observed absorption lines common to [[hydroxyl]], in reflected sunlight, providing evidence of large quantities of water ice, on the lunar surface.

The inclusions were formed during explosive eruptions on the Moon approximately 3.7 billion years ago. This concentration is comparable with that of magma in Earth's [[upper mantle]]. Although of considerable selenological interest, this insight does not mean that water is easily available since the sample originated many kilometers below the surface, and the inclusions are so difficult to access that it took 39 years to find them with a state-of-the-art ion microprobe instrument.

Due to [[tidal locking]], the Moon has a 1:1 [[orbital resonance|spin–orbit resonance]]. This [[rotation]]–[[orbit]] ratio makes the Moon's orbital periods around Earth equal to its corresponding [[rotation period]]s. This is the reason for only one side of the Moon, its so-called [[near side]], being visible from Earth. That said, while the movement of the Moon is in resonance, it still is not without nuances such as [[libration]], resulting in slightly changing perspectives, making over time and location on Earth about 59% of the Moon's surface visible from Earth.<ref name="Liberation">{{cite web |last=Stern |first=David |date=March 30, 2014 |title=Libration of the Moon |url=https://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Smoon4.htm |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200522153419/https://www-istp.gsfc.nasa.gov/stargaze/Smoon4.htm |archive-date=May 22, 2020 |access-date=February 11, 2020 |website=NASA}}</ref>

Unlike most satellites of other planets, the Moon's orbital plane is closer to the [[ecliptic plane]] than to the planet's [[equatorial plane]]. The Moon's orbit is subtly [[perturbation (astronomy)|perturbed]] by the Sun and Earth in many small, complex and interacting ways. For example, the plane of the Moon's orbit [[lunar standstill|gradually rotates]] once every 18.61{{nbsp}}years,<ref>{{cite journal |author1=Haigh, I.

=== Tidal effects ===
{{main |Tidal force |Tidal acceleration |Tide |Theory of tides}}
[[File:Tide animation.gif|thumb|Simplified diagram of Earth bulging, being pulled and stretched toward the Moon by its gravity, which is the main driver of the [[tide]]s. The Ocean and Earth are being pulled more where it is closer to the Moon, causing [[tidal force]]s to be weaker at the far-side of Earth creating a second bulge and high-tide. The animation shows the change of the Moon's position on its inclined orbit.]]
The gravitational attraction that Earth and the Moon (as well as the Sun) exert on each other manifests in a slightly greater attraction on the sides closest to each other, resulting in [[tidal forces]]. [[Ocean tides]] are the most widely experienced result of this, but tidal forces also considerably affect other mechanics of Earth, as well as the Moon and their system.

The lunar solid crust experiences tides of around {{convert|10|cm|4=0|abbr=on}} amplitude over 27&nbsp;days, with three components: a fixed one due to Earth, because they are in [[synchronous rotation]], a variable tide due to orbital eccentricity and inclination, and a small varying component from the Sun.<ref name="touma1994" /> The Earth-induced variable component arises from changing distance and [[libration]], a result of the Moon's orbital eccentricity and inclination (if the Moon's orbit were perfectly circular and un-inclined, there would only be solar tides).<ref name="touma1994" /> According to recent research, scientists suggest that the Moon's influence on the Earth may contribute to maintaining [[Earth's magnetic field]].<ref>{{cite web |author=Todd |first=Iain |date=March 31, 2018 |title=Is the Moon maintaining Earth's magnetism? |url=https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/news/is-the-moon-maintaining-earths-magnetism/ |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20200922194637/https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/news/is-the-moon-maintaining-earths-magnetism/ |archive-date=September 22, 2020 |access-date=November 16, 2020 |website=[[BBC Sky at Night]] Magazine}}</ref>

The cumulative effects of stress built up by these tidal forces produces [[moonquakes]]. Moonquakes are much less common and weaker than are earthquakes, although moonquakes can last for up to an hour&nbsp;– significantly longer than terrestrial quakes&nbsp;– because of scattering of the seismic vibrations in the dry fragmented upper crust. The existence of moonquakes was an unexpected discovery from [[seismometer]]s placed on the Moon by [[Apollo program|Apollo]] [[astronaut]]s from 1969 through 1972.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Latham |first1=Gary |date=1972 |last2=Ewing |first2=Maurice |last3=Dorman |first3=James |last4=Lammlein |first4=David |last5=Press |first5=Frank |last6=Toksőz |first6=Naft |last7=Sutton |first7=George |last8=Duennebier |first8=Fred |last9=Nakamura |first9=Yosio |title=Moonquakes and lunar tectonism |journal=[[Earth, Moon, and Planets]] |volume=4 |issue=3–4 |pages=373–382 |doi=10.1007/BF00562004 |bibcode=1972Moon....4..373L |s2cid=120692155}}</ref>

The most commonly known effect of tidal forces is elevated sea levels called ocean tides.<ref name="Lambeck1977" /> While the Moon exerts most of the tidal forces, the Sun also exerts tidal forces and therefore contributes to the tides as much as 40% of the Moon's tidal force; producing in interplay the [[Spring tide|spring and neap tides]].<ref name="Lambeck1977" />

The tides are two bulges in the Earth's oceans, one on the side facing the Moon and the other on the side opposite. As the Earth rotates on its axis, one of the ocean bulges (high tide) is held in place "under" the Moon, while another such tide is opposite. The tide under the Moon is explained by the Moon's gravity being stronger on the water close to it. The tide on the opposite side can be explained either by the centrifugal force as the Earth orbits the [[barycenter]] or by the water's inertia as the Moon's gravity is stronger on the solid Earth close to it and it is pulled away from the farther water.<ref>{{Cite web |last=Richard |first=Feynman |author-link=Richard Feynman |title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol. I Ch. 7: The Theory of Gravitation |url=https://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html |access-date=2025-06-30 |website=www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |last1=Feynman |first1=Richard |title=Feynman's Lectures on Physics – The Law of Gravitation |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-UFr1X0prbo&t=1503s |website=YouTube |date=October 24, 2020 |access-date=5 December 2024}}</ref>

Thus, there are two high tides, and two low tides in about 24 hours.<ref name="Lambeck1977" /> Since the Moon is orbiting the Earth in the same direction of the Earth's rotation, the high tides occur about every 12 hours and 25 minutes; the 25 minutes is due to the Moon's time to orbit the Earth.

If the Earth were a water world (one with no continents) it would produce a tide of only one meter, and that tide would be very predictable, but the ocean tides are greatly modified by other effects:
* the frictional coupling of water to Earth's rotation through the ocean floors
* the [[inertia]] of water's movement
* ocean basins that grow shallower near land
* the sloshing of water between different ocean basins<ref>{{cite journal |last=Le Provost |first=C. |author2=Bennett, A.F. |author3=Cartwright, D.E. |date=1995 |title=Ocean Tides for and from TOPEX/POSEIDON |pages=639–642 |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |pmid=17745840 |volume=267 |issue=5198 |bibcode=1995Sci...267..639L |doi=10.1126/science.267.5198.639 |s2cid=13584636}}</ref>
As a result, the timing of the tides at most points on the Earth is a product of observations that are explained, incidentally, by theory.

==== System evolution ====
Delays in the tidal peaks of both ocean and solid-body tides cause [[torque]] in opposition to the Earth's rotation. This "drains" [[angular momentum]] and rotational [[kinetic energy]] from Earth's rotation, slowing the Earth's rotation.<ref name="Lambeck1977" /><ref name="touma1994" /> That angular momentum, lost from the Earth, is transferred to the Moon in a process known as [[tidal acceleration]], which lifts the Moon into a higher orbit while lowering orbital speed around the Earth. This has resulted in the length of a [[anomalistic month]] having increased from 20 days to today's 27.55 days over the course of 3.2 billion years.<ref name="m870">{{cite journal | last1=Eulenfeld | first1=Tom | last2=Heubeck | first2=Christoph | title=Constraints on Moon's Orbit 3.2 Billion Years Ago From Tidal Bundle Data | journal=Journal of Geophysical Research: Planets | volume=128 | issue=1 | date=2023 | issn=2169-9097 | doi=10.1029/2022JE007466 | doi-access=free | article-number=e2022JE007466 | arxiv=2207.05464 | bibcode=2023JGRE..12807466E }}</ref>

Thus the distance between Earth and Moon is increasing, and the Earth's rotation is slowing in reaction.<ref name="touma1994" /> Measurements from laser reflectors left during the Apollo missions ([[lunar Laser Ranging experiments|lunar ranging experiments]]) have found that the Moon's distance increases by {{Convert |38 |mm |abbr=on}} per year (roughly the rate at which human fingernails grow).<ref>{{cite journal |last=Chapront |first=J. |author2=Chapront-Touzé, M. |author3=Francou, G. |date=2002 |title=A new determination of lunar orbital parameters, precession constant and tidal acceleration from LLR measurements |journal=[[Astronomy and Astrophysics]] |volume=387 |issue=2 |pages=700–709 |bibcode=2002A&A...387..700C |doi=10.1051/0004-6361:20020420 |doi-access=free |s2cid=55131241}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12311119 |title=Why the Moon is getting further away from Earth |newspaper=BBC News |date=February 1, 2011 |access-date=September 18, 2015 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150925185706/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-12311119 |archive-date=September 25, 2015}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal |last1=Williams |first1=James G. |last2=Boggs |first2=Dale H. |date=2016 |title=Secular tidal changes in lunar orbit and Earth rotation |journal=Celestial Mechanics and Dynamical Astronomy |language=en |volume=126 |issue=1 |pages=89–129 |doi=10.1007/s10569-016-9702-3 |bibcode=2016CeMDA.126...89W |s2cid=124256137 |issn=1572-9478 }}</ref>

This tidal drag makes the rotation of the Earth, and the orbital period of the Moon very slowly match.

If the Earth–Moon system is not engulfed by the enlarged Sun, the drag from the solar atmosphere can cause the orbit of the Moon to decay. Once the orbit of the Moon closes to a distance of {{convert|18470|km|mi|abbr=on}}, it will cross Earth's [[Roche limit]], meaning that tidal interaction with Earth would break apart the Moon, turning it into a [[ring system]]. Most of the orbiting rings will begin to decay, and the debris will impact Earth. Hence, even if the Sun does not swallow up Earth, the planet may be left moonless.<ref name=space070122>{{citation |first=David |last=Powell |date=January 22, 2007 |title=Earth's Moon Destined to Disintegrate |work=Space.com |publisher=Tech Media Network |url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070122_temporary_moon.html |access-date=June 1, 2010 |archive-date=September 6, 2008 |archive-url=https://archive.today/20080906222127/http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/070122_temporary_moon.html |url-status=live}}</ref>

=== Rotation ===
[[File:Tidal locking of the Moon with the Earth.gif|thumb|Comparison between the Moon on the left, rotating tidally locked (correct), and with the Moon on the right, without rotation (incorrect)]]
The [[synchronous rotation|tidally locked synchronous rotation]] of the Moon as it orbits the Earth results in it always keeping nearly the same face turned towards the planet. The side of the Moon that faces Earth is called the [[near side]], and the opposite the [[far side of the Moon|far side]]. The far side is often inaccurately called the "dark side", but it is in fact illuminated as often as the near side: once every 29.5 Earth days. During [[dark moon]] to [[new moon]], the near side is dark.<ref>{{cite web |title=Dark Side of the Moon |author=Phil Plait |publisher=[[Bad Astronomy]]: Misconceptions |url=http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/dark_side.html |access-date=February 15, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100412192834/http://www.badastronomy.com/bad/misc/dark_side.html |archive-date=April 12, 2010 |author-link=Phil Plait}}</ref>

The Moon originally rotated at a faster rate, but early in its history its rotation slowed and became [[tidally locked]] in this orientation as a result of [[friction]]al effects associated with [[tidal force|tidal]] deformations caused by Earth.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Alexander |first=M.E. |title=The Weak Friction Approximation and Tidal Evolution in Close Binary Systems |journal=[[Astrophysics and Space Science]] |date=1973 |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=459–508 |bibcode=1973Ap&SS..23..459A |doi=10.1007/BF00645172 |s2cid=122918899}}</ref> With time, the energy of rotation of the Moon on its axis was dissipated as heat, until there was no rotation of the Moon relative to Earth. In 2016, planetary scientists using data collected on the 1998–99 NASA ''[[Lunar Prospector]]'' mission found two hydrogen-rich areas (most likely former water ice) on opposite sides of the Moon. It is speculated that these patches were the poles of the Moon billions of years ago before it was tidally locked to Earth.<ref>{{cite news |title=Moon used to spin 'on different axis' |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35883576 |access-date=March 23, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160323203442/http://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-35883576 |archive-date=March 23, 2016 |work=BBC News |date=March 23, 2016}}</ref>

=== Illumination and phases ===

The Moon rotates, as it orbits Earth, changing orientation toward the Sun, experiencing a [[lunar day]]. A lunar day is equal to one [[lunar month]] (one synodic orbit around Earth) due to it being [[tidal locking|tidally locked]] to Earth. Since the Moon is not tidally locked to the Sun, lunar daylight and night times both occur around the Moon. The changing position of the illumination of the Moon by the Sun during a lunar day is observable from Earth as the changing [[lunar phase]]s, waxing crescent being the sunrise and the waning crescent the sunset phase of a day observed from afar.<ref name="r040">{{cite web | title=Phases of the Moon explained | website=BBC Sky at Night Magazine | date=January 21, 2025 | url=https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/why-does-the-moons-appearance-change | access-date=April 29, 2025}}</ref>

Lunar night is the darkest on the far side and during lunar eclipses on the near side (and darker than a moonless night on Earth). During its night, the near side is illuminated by [[Earthlight]] to the extent that lunar surface features may be observable from Earth. Earthshine makes the night on the near side about 43 times brighter, and sometimes even 55 times brighter than a night on Earth illuminated by the light of the full moon.<ref name="u988">{{cite web | last=Siegel | first=Ethan | title=Ask Ethan: How Bright Is The Earth As Seen From The Moon? | website=Forbes | date=March 18, 2017 | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/startswithabang/2017/03/18/ask-ethan-how-bright-is-the-earth-as-seen-from-the-moon/ | access-date=April 29, 2025}}</ref>

In Earth's sky brightness and apparent size of the Moon changes also due to its elliptic [[Orbit of the Moon|orbit around Earth]]. At [[perigee]] (closest), since the Moon is up to 14% closer to Earth than at [[apogee]] (most distant), it subtends a [[solid angle]] which is up to 30% larger. Consequently, given the same phase, the Moon's brightness also varies by up to 30% between apogee and perigee.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.space.com/34515-supermoon-guide.html |title=Supermoon November 2016 |date=November 13, 2016 |access-date=November 14, 2016 |publisher=Space.com |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161114220725/http://www.space.com/34515-supermoon-guide.html |archive-date=November 14, 2016}}</ref> A full (or new) moon at such a position is called a [[supermoon]].<ref name="size1">{{cite web |author=Phillips |first=Tony |date=March 16, 2011 |title=Super Full Moon |url=https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16mar_supermoon/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120507035348/https://science.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2011/16mar_supermoon/ |archive-date=May 7, 2012 |access-date=March 19, 2011 |publisher=NASA}}</ref><ref name="size2">{{cite news |author=De Atley |first=Richard K. |date=March 18, 2011 |title=Full moon tonight is as close as it gets |url=http://www.pe.com/localnews/stories/PE_News_Local_D_moon19.23a6364.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110322161600/http://www.pe.com/localnews/stories/PE_News_Local_D_moon19.23a6364.html |archive-date=March 22, 2011 |access-date=March 19, 2011 |newspaper=[[The Press-Enterprise]]}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/mar/19/super-moon-closest-point-years |title='Super moon' to reach closest point for almost 20 years |newspaper=The Guardian |date=March 19, 2011 |access-date=March 19, 2011 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131225175506/http://www.theguardian.com/science/2011/mar/19/super-moon-closest-point-years |archive-date=December 25, 2013}}</ref>

Each of the four intermediate phases of the Moon lasts, on average, about seven days (approximately 7.38 days), but this duration can vary by about ±11% due to the change in the distance between the Moon and Earth between apogee (farthest point) and perigee (closest point).

The number of days since the most recent new moon is called the Moon's age.<ref>{{Cite web |title=Moon Age Today {{!}} Moonagetoday.org |url=https://moonagetoday.org/ |access-date=2025-10-19 |language=en}}</ref> A complete cycle of lunar phases is known as a lunation.<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-10-15 |title=lunation |url=https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/lunation |access-date=2025-10-19 |website=dictionary.cambridge.org |language=en}}</ref>

The approximate age and phase of the Moon for any date can be calculated by determining the number of days since a known new moon (e.g., January 1, 1900, or August 11, 1999) and dividing that value by the average length of a synodic month (29.53059 days).<ref>{{Cite web |title=Synodic month {{!}} astronomy {{!}} Britannica |url=https://www.britannica.com/science/synodic-month |access-date=2025-10-19 |website=www.britannica.com |language=en}}</ref> The remainder of the division represents the Moon's age. This method assumes a perfectly circular orbit and does not consider the exact time of the new moon, so results may be off by a few hours. Accuracy decreases as the date moves away from the reference date.

This simplified calculation is suitable for general or decorative purposes, such as moon phase clocks. More precise applications that take into account the Moon's apogee and perigee require more complex methods.

Due to lunar libration, it is sometimes possible to see slightly more than the full moon (up to about 101%) or a small part of its far side (up to 5%).<ref>{{Cite web |date=2025-05-14 |title=Lunar libration: what it is and how to photograph it |url=https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/advice/skills/lunar-libration-what-is |access-date=2025-10-19 |website=BBC Sky at Night Magazine |language=en}}</ref>

As it orbits, the Moon moves an average of 13° eastward on the celestial sphere every day. This means that from new moon onward, the moon will become increasingly distant from the Sun, becoming more prominent until full moon, when it appears to be on the opposite side of the Sun. Thereafter, the Moon appears to move closer to the Sun until a new moon occurs. The position and time at which the Moon rises on the eastern horizon vary continually, primarily due to the inclination of the lunar orbit , which is more than 5° relative to the Earth's equator, which in turn is inclined more than 23° to the ecliptic.

==== Observational phenomena ====
There has been historical controversy over whether observed features on the Moon's surface change over time. Today, many of these claims are thought to be illusory, resulting from observation under different lighting conditions, poor [[astronomical seeing]], or inadequate drawings. However, [[outgassing]] does occasionally occur and could be responsible for a minor percentage of the reported [[lunar transient phenomena]]. Recently, it has been suggested that a roughly {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} diameter region of the lunar surface was modified by a gas release event about a million years ago.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Taylor |first=G.

=== Albedo and true color of the surface ===
The Moon's appearance is shaped by its reflective properties and surface composition. Its [[albedo]] is about 0.12,<ref>{{Cite web |last=Cain |first=Fraser |date=2008-10-23 |title=Moon Albedo |url=https://www.universetoday.com/articles/moon-albedo |access-date=2025-11-04 |website=[[Universe Today]] |language=en}}</ref> comparable to worn [[Asphalt concrete|asphalt]], making it relatively dark despite its brightness in the night sky. This low albedo represents the reflectance of the lunar regolith, a layer of fine rock fragments created by meteorite impacts. Light scattering by the regolith causes the Moon to appear much brighter at full moon than at quarter phases.

The Moon's true color, without atmospheric effects, is a muted brownish-gray.<ref>[https://www.skyatnightmagazine.com/space-science/what-colour-is-the-moon Color of the Moon]</ref> This results from silicate minerals in the regolith, with darker basaltic plains (maria) and lighter feldspar-rich highlands. The maria, formed by ancient volcanic flows, contain more iron and titanium, giving them a darker tone. From Earth, the Moon's color can be altered by the atmosphere, appearing red during lunar eclipses or occasionally blue due to volcanic particles.

The Moon also exhibits retro-reflection,<ref>[https://the-moon.us/wiki/Retro-Reflection_phenomena Retro-Reflection of Moon]</ref> scattering light back toward its source and creating a uniform brightness across its disc without significant limb darkening. Its apparent size and brightness vary due to its elliptical orbit, appearing up to 30% brighter and 14% larger at perigee compared to apogee, a phenomenon known as a "Supermoon".

At times, the Moon can appear red or blue. It may appear red during a [[lunar eclipse]], because of the red spectrum of the Sun's light being [[refracted]] onto the Moon by Earth's atmosphere. Because of this red color, lunar eclipses are also sometimes called [[Blood Moon (eclipse)|blood moons]]. The Moon can also seem red when it appears at low angles and through a thick atmosphere.

The Moon may appear blue depending on the presence of certain particles in the air,<ref name="Science Mission Directorate 2020">{{cite web |date=November 11, 2020 |title=Colors of the Moon |url=https://science.nasa.gov/colors-moon |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220409212600/https://science.nasa.gov/colors-moon |archive-date=April 9, 2022 |access-date=April 9, 2022 |website=Science Mission Directorate}}</ref> such as volcanic particles,<ref>{{cite web |last=Gibbs |first=Philip |date=May 1997 |title=Why is the sky blue? |url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151102085211/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/BlueSky/blue_sky.html |archive-date=November 2, 2015 |access-date=November 4, 2015 |website=math.ucr.edu |quote=... may cause the moon to have a blue tinge since the red light has been scattered out.}}</ref> in which case it can be called a [[Blue moon#Whole blue moon|blue moon]].

Because the words "red moon" and "blue moon" can also be used to refer to specific [[full moon]]s of the year, they do not always refer to the presence of red or blue [[moonlight]].

=== Eclipses ===

Eclipses only occur when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are all in a straight line (termed "[[Syzygy (astronomy)|syzygy]]"). [[Solar eclipse]]s occur at [[new moon]], when the Moon is between the Sun and Earth. In contrast, [[lunar eclipse]]s occur at full moon, when Earth is between the Sun and Moon. The apparent size of the Moon is roughly the same as that of the Sun, with both being viewed at close to one-half a degree wide. The Sun is much larger than the Moon, but it is the vastly greater distance that gives it the same apparent size as the much closer and much smaller Moon from the perspective of Earth. The variations in apparent size, due to the non-circular orbits, are nearly the same as well, though occurring in different cycles. This makes possible both [[total eclipse|total]] (with the Moon appearing larger than the Sun) and [[annular eclipse|annular]] (with the Moon appearing smaller than the Sun) solar eclipses.<ref>{{cite web |first=F. |last=Espenak |date=2000 |url=http://www.mreclipse.com/Special/SEprimer.html |title=Solar Eclipses for Beginners |publisher=MrEclip |access-date=March 17, 2010 |archive-date=May 24, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524172606/http://www.mreclipse.com/Special/SEprimer.html }}</ref> In a total eclipse, the Moon completely covers the disc of the Sun and the [[solar corona]] becomes visible to the [[naked eye]].

Because the distance between the Moon and Earth is very slowly increasing over time,<ref name="Lambeck1977" /> the angular diameter of the Moon is decreasing. As it evolves toward becoming a [[red giant]], the size of the Sun, and its apparent diameter in the sky, are slowly increasing.{{efn|name=size changes}} The combination of these two changes means that hundreds of millions of years ago, the Moon would always completely cover the Sun on solar eclipses, and no annular eclipses were possible. Likewise, hundreds of millions of years in the future, the Moon will no longer cover the Sun completely, and total solar eclipses will not occur.<ref name=fourmilab>{{cite web |last=Walker |first=John |url=http://www.fourmilab.ch/images/peri_apo/ |title=Moon near Perigee, Earth near Aphelion |publisher=[[Fourmilab]] |date=July 10, 2004 |access-date=December 25, 2013 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208153430/http://www.fourmilab.ch/images/peri_apo/ |archive-date=December 8, 2013}}</ref>

As the Moon's orbit around Earth is inclined by about 5.145° (5°&nbsp;9′) to the [[ecliptic|orbit of Earth around the Sun]], eclipses do not occur at every full and new moon. For an eclipse to occur, the Moon must be near the intersection of the two orbital planes.<ref name="eclipse" /> The periodicity and recurrence of eclipses of the Sun by the Moon, and of the Moon by Earth, is described by the [[Saros (astronomy)|saros]], which has a period of approximately 18&nbsp;years.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEsaros/SEsaros.html |last=Espenak |first=F. |title=Saros Cycle |publisher=NASA |access-date=March 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071030225501/http://sunearth.gsfc.nasa.gov/eclipse/SEsaros/SEsaros.html |archive-date=October 30, 2007}}</ref>

Because the Moon continuously blocks the view of a half-degree-wide circular area of the sky,{{Efn |name=area}}<ref>{{cite magazine |title=The Square Degree as a Unit of Celestial Area |author=Guthrie, D.V. |date=1947 |magazine=[[Popular Astronomy (US magazine)|Popular Astronomy]] |volume=55 |pages=200–203 |bibcode=1947PA.....55..200G}}</ref> the related phenomenon of [[occultation]] occurs when a bright star or planet passes behind the Moon and is occulted: hidden from view. In this way, a solar eclipse is an occultation of the Sun. Because the Moon is comparatively close to Earth, occultations of individual stars are not visible everywhere on the planet, nor at the same time. Because of the [[precession]] of the lunar orbit, each year different stars are occulted.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://occsec.wellington.net.nz/total/totoccs.htm |title=Total Lunar Occultations |publisher=[[Royal Astronomical Society of New Zealand]] |access-date=March 17, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100223022627/http://occsec.wellington.net.nz/total/totoccs.htm |archive-date=February 23, 2010}}</ref>

=== Telescopic exploration (1609–1959) ===
[[File:Galileo's sketches of the moon (cropped).png|thumb|The first published sketches of one of the first telescopic observations of the Moon, from the ground-breaking ''[[Sidereus Nuncius]]'' (1610) by [[Galileo Galilei]], providing among other findings the first descriptions of the Moon's topography]]

The [[telescope]] was developed and reported on in 1608. The first record of telescopic astronomy and rough mapping of the Moon's features is from early summer 1609 by [[Thomas Harriot]], but which he did not publish. At the same time [[Galileo Galilei]] too started to use telescopes to observe the sky and the Moon, recording later that year more detailed observations and crucial conclusions, such as that the Moon was not smooth, featuring mountains and craters, which he published in 1610 in his ground-breaking and soon widely discussed book {{lang|la |[[Sidereus Nuncius]]}}.

Later in the 17th century, the efforts of [[Giovanni Battista Riccioli]] and [[Francesco Maria Grimaldi]] led to the system of naming of lunar features in use today. The more exact 1834–1836 ''[[Mappa Selenographica]]'' of [[Wilhelm Beer]] and [[Johann Heinrich von Mädler]], and their associated 1837 book {{lang|de |Der Mond}}, the first [[trigonometry|trigonometrically]] accurate study of lunar features, included the heights of more than a thousand mountains, and introduced the study of the Moon at accuracies possible in earthly geography.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Consolmagno |first=Guy J. |date=1996 |title=Astronomy, Science Fiction and Popular Culture: 1277 to 2001 (And beyond) |journal=[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]] |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=127–132 |jstor=1576348 |doi=10.2307/1576348 |s2cid=41861791}}</ref> Lunar craters, first noted by Galileo, were thought to be [[volcanic]] until the 1870s proposal of [[Richard Proctor]] that they were formed by collisions.<ref name="worldbook" /> This view gained support in 1892 from the experimentation of geologist [[Grove Karl Gilbert]], and from comparative studies from 1920 to the 1940s,<ref name="Hall1977" /> leading to the development of [[lunar geologic timescale|lunar stratigraphy]], which by the 1950s was becoming a new and growing branch of [[astrogeology]].<ref name="worldbook" />

=== First missions to the Moon (1959–1976) ===
{{see also|Space Race|Moon landing}}

After [[World War II]] the first [[launch system]]s were developed and by the end of the 1950s they reached capabilities that allowed the [[Soviet Union]] and the [[United States]] to launch [[spacecraft]] into space. The [[Cold War]] fueled a closely followed development of launch systems by the two states, resulting in the so-called [[Space Race]] and its later phase the Moon Race, accelerating efforts and interest in [[exploration of the Moon]].

After the first spaceflight of [[Sputnik 1]] in 1957 during [[International Geophysical Year]] the spacecraft of the Soviet Union's [[Luna programme|''Luna'' program]] were the first to accomplish a number of goals.

By the end of the year ''[[Luna 3]]'' reached as the first human-made object the normally occluded [[far side of the Moon]], taking the first photographs of it.

Following President [[John F. Kennedy]]'s 1961 commitment to a crewed Moon landing before the end of the decade, the United States, under NASA leadership, launched a series of uncrewed probes to develop an understanding of the lunar surface in preparation for human missions: the [[Jet Propulsion Laboratory]]'s [[Ranger program]], the [[Lunar Orbiter program]] and the [[Surveyor program]]. The crewed [[Apollo program]] was developed in parallel; after a series of uncrewed and crewed tests of the Apollo spacecraft in Earth orbit, and spurred on by a potential [[Soviet human lunar programs|Soviet lunar human landing]], in 1968 [[Apollo 8]] made the first human mission to lunar orbit (the first Earthlings, two tortoises, had circled the Moon three months earlier on the Soviet Union's [[Zond 5]], followed by turtles on [[Zond 6]]).

=== Moon Treaty and explorational absence (1976–1990) ===
{{Main|Moon Treaty}}
Following the [[Luna 24|last Soviet mission to the Moon]] of 1976, there was little further lunar exploration for fourteen years. Astronautics had shifted its focus towards the exploration of the [[inner Solar System|inner]] (e.g. [[Venera program]]) and [[outer Solar System|outer]] (e.g. [[Pioneer 10]], 1972) [[Solar System]] [[planet]]s, but also towards [[Geocentric orbit|Earth orbit]], developing and continuously operating, beside [[communication satellite]]s, [[Earth observation satellite]]s (e.g. [[Landsat program]], 1972), [[space telescope]]s and particularly [[space station]]s (e.g. [[Salyut program]], 1971).

Negotiation in 1979 of [[Moon treaty]], and its subsequent ratification in 1984 was the only major activity regarding the Moon until 1990.

=== Renewed exploration (1990–present) ===
In 1990 ''[[Hiten (spacecraft)|Hiten]]'' – ''Hagoromo'',<ref>{{cite web |title=Hiten-Hagomoro |publisher=NASA |url=http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Hiten&Display=ReadMore |access-date=March 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614115823/http://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/profile.cfm?MCode=Hiten&Display=ReadMore |archive-date=June 14, 2011}}</ref> the first dedicated lunar mission since 1976, reached the Moon. Sent by Japan, it became the first mission that was not a Soviet Union or U.S. mission to the Moon.

In 1994, the U.S. dedicated a mission to fly a spacecraft (''[[Clementine (spacecraft)|Clementine]]'') to the Moon again for the first time since 1973. This mission obtained the first near-global topographic map of the Moon, and the first global [[multispectral]] images of the lunar surface.<ref>{{cite web |title=Clementine information |publisher=NASA |date=1994 |url=http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/cleminfo.html |access-date=March 29, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100925095846/http://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/cleminfo.html |archive-date=September 25, 2010}}</ref> In 1998, this was followed by the ''[[Lunar Prospector]]'' mission, whose instruments indicated the presence of excess hydrogen at the lunar poles, which is likely to have been caused by the presence of water ice in the upper few meters of the regolith within permanently shadowed craters.<ref>{{cite web |title=Lunar Prospector: Neutron Spectrometer |publisher=NASA |url=http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/results/neutron.htm |date=2001 |access-date=March 29, 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100527105801/http://lunar.arc.nasa.gov/results/neutron.htm |archive-date=May 27, 2010}}</ref>

The next years saw a row of first missions to the Moon by a new group of states actively exploring the Moon.
Between 2004 and 2006 the first spacecraft by the [[European Space Agency]] (ESA) (''[[SMART-1]]'') reached the Moon, recording the first detailed survey of chemical elements on the lunar surface.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/SMART-1/SEMSDE1A6BD_0.html |title=SMART-1 factsheet |date=February 26, 2007 |publisher=[[European Space Agency]] |access-date=March 29, 2010 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100323044139/http://www.esa.int/SPECIALS/SMART-1/SEMSDE1A6BD_0.html |archive-date=March 23, 2010}}</ref>

China continued its lunar program in 2010 with ''[[Chang'e 2]]'', mapping the surface at a higher resolution over an eight-month period, and in 2013 with ''[[Chang'e 3]]'', a lunar [[lander (spacecraft)|lander]] along with a [[lunar rover]] named ''[[Yutu (rover)|Yutu]]'' ({{Lang-zh|c=玉兔|l=Jade Rabbit}}). This was the first lunar rover mission since ''[[Lunokhod 2]]'' in 1973 and the first lunar [[soft landing]] since ''[[Luna 24]]'' in 1976, making China the third country to achieve this.

In 2014 the first privately funded probe, the [[Manfred Memorial Moon Mission]], reached the Moon.

Another Chinese rover mission, ''[[Chang'e 4]]'', achieved the first landing on [[Far side of the Moon|the Moon's far side]] in early 2019.<ref>{{cite web |title=China Outlines New Rockets, Space Station and Moon Plans |url=http://www.space.com/28809-china-rocket-family-moon-plans.html |date=March 17, 2015 |first=Leonard |last=David |publisher=[[Space.com]] |access-date=June 29, 2016 |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160701055507/http://www.space.com/28809-china-rocket-family-moon-plans.html |archive-date=July 1, 2016}}</ref>

In 1959 the first extraterrestrial probes reached the Moon ([[Luna program]]), just a year into the [[space age]], after the first ever orbital flight. Since then, humans have sent a range of probes and people to the Moon. The first stay of people on the Moon was conducted in 1969, in a series of crewed exploration missions (the [[Apollo Program]]), the last having taken place in 1972.

Uninterrupted presence has been the case through the [[List of artificial objects on the Moon|remains]] of impactors, landings and [[List of extraterrestrial orbiters#Moon|lunar orbiters]]. Some landings and orbiters have maintained a small lunar infrastructure, providing continuous observation and communication at the Moon. Longterm missions continuing to be active are some orbiters such as the 2009-launched [[Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter]] surveilling the Moon for future missions, as well as some Landers such as the 2013-launched [[Chang'e 3]] with its Lunar Ultraviolet Telescope still operational.<ref>{{cite web |author=Jones |first=Andrew |date=September 23, 2020 |title=China's Chang'e 3 lunar lander still going strong after 7 years on the moon |url=https://www.space.com/china-change-3-moon-lander-lasts-7-years |url-status=live |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20201125043612/https://www.space.com/china-change-3-moon-lander-lasts-7-years |archive-date=November 25, 2020 |access-date=November 16, 2020 |website=[[Space.com]]}}</ref>

Increasing human activity in [[cislunar space]] as well as on the Moon's surface, particularly missions at the far side of the Moon or the [[Lunar north pole|lunar north]] and [[Lunar south pole|south polar]] regions, are in need for a lunar infrastructure.

=== Coordination and regulation ===
Increasing human activity at the Moon has raised the need for coordination to safeguard international and commercial lunar activity. Issues from cooperation to mere coordination, through for example the development of a shared [[Lunar time]], have been raised.

In particular the establishment of an [[Internationalism (politics)|international]] or [[United Nations]] regulatory regime for lunar human activity has been called for by the [[Moon Treaty]] and suggested through an ''Implementation Agreement'',<ref name="The Space Review 2020"/><ref name="The Space Treaty Institute – Dedicated to Peace and Sustainability in Outer Space. Our Mission"/> but remains contentious. Current lunar programs are [[Multilateralism|multilateral]], with the US-led [[Artemis program]] and the China-led [[International Lunar Research Station]]. For broader international cooperation and coordination, the [[International Lunar Exploration Working Group]] (ILEWG), the [[Moon Village|Moon Village Association]] (MVA) and more generally the International Space Exploration Coordination Group (ISECG) has been established.

This lunar timekeeping gave rise to the historically dominant, but varied, [[lunisolar calendar]]s. The 7th-century [[Islamic calendar]] is an example of a purely [[lunar calendar]], where months are traditionally determined by the visual sighting of the hilal, or earliest crescent moon, over the horizon.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Lunar Crescent Visibility Criterion and Islamic Calendar |last=Ilyas |first=Mohammad |journal=Quarterly Journal of the Royal Astronomical Society |volume=35 |page=425 |date=March 1994 |bibcode=1994QJRAS..35..425I}}</ref>

Of particular significance has been the occasion of [[full moon]], highlighted and celebrated in a range of calendars and cultures, an example being the Buddhist [[Vesak]]. The full moon around the [[March equinox|southern]] or [[September equinox|northern autumnal equinox]] is often called the [[harvest moon]] and is celebrated with festivities such as the [[Harvest Moon Festival]] of the [[Chinese lunar calendar]], its second most important celebration after [[Chinese New Year|the Chinese]] lunisolar [[Lunar New Year]].<ref name="Confucius Institute for Scotland 2022">{{cite web |title=Mid-Autumn Festival Celebration |website=Confucius Institute for Scotland |date=August 30, 2022 |url=https://www.confuciusinstitute.ac.uk/events/mid-autumn-festival-activities-10-september/ |access-date=November 22, 2022 |archive-date=November 22, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20221122172612/https://www.confuciusinstitute.ac.uk/events/mid-autumn-festival-activities-10-september/ |url-status=live}}</ref>

Furthermore, association of time with the Moon can also be found in religion, such as the ancient Egyptian temporal and lunar deity [[Khonsu]].

Humans have not only observed the Moon since [[prehistoric times]], but have also developed intricate perceptions of the Moon. Over time the Moon has been characterized and associated in many different ways, from having a [[Spirit (vital essence)|spirit]] or being [[Lunar deity|a deity]], and an [[aspect (religion)|aspect]] thereof or an aspect [[Moon (astrology)|in astrology]], being made an important part of many [[cosmology|cosmologies]].

This rich history of humans viewing the Moon has been evidenced starting with depictions from 40,000 [[Before present|BP]] and in written form from the [[4th millennium BCE]] in the earliest cases of [[writing]]. The oldest named astronomer and poet [[Enheduanna]], [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] high priestess to the lunar deity [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna/Sin]] and daughter of [[Sargon the Great]] ({{circa|2334}} &ndash; {{circa|2279}} BCE), tracked the Moon and wrote poems about her divine Moon.<ref name="c099"/>

==== Crescent ====
For the representation of the Moon, especially its [[lunar phase]]s, the [[crescent]] (🌙) has been a recurring symbol in a range of cultures since at least 3,000 BCE or possibly earlier with bull horns dating to the earliest [[cave painting]]s at 40,000 [[Before present|BP]].<ref name="e093"/><ref name="k874"/> In [[writing system]]s such as Chinese the crescent has developed into the symbol {{lang|zh |{{linktext|月}}}}, the word for Moon, and in ancient Egyptian it was the symbol {{linktext|𓇹}}, meaning Moon and spelled like the ancient Egyptian lunar deity ''[[Iah]]'',<ref name="Hart 2005 p. 77">{{cite book |last=Hart |first=G. |title=The Routledge Dictionary of Egyptian Gods and Goddesses |publisher=Taylor & Francis |series=Routledge Dictionaries |year=2005 |isbn=978-1-134-28424-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1LAiPylZm4C&pg=PA77 |access-date=February 23, 2022 |page=77 |archive-date=July 25, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220725234921/https://books.google.com/books?id=Q1LAiPylZm4C&pg=PA77 |url-status=live}}</ref> which the other ancient Egyptian lunar deities [[Khonsu]] and [[Thoth]] were associated with.

The particular arrangement of the crescent with a star known as the [[star and crescent]] (☪️) goes back to the Bronze Age, representing either the Sun and Moon, or the Moon and the planet Venus, in combination. It came to represent the selene goddess [[Artemis]], and via the patronage of [[Hecate]], which as [[triple deity]] under the [[epithet]] ''trimorphos''/''trivia'' included aspects of Artemis/[[Diana (mythology)|Diana]], came to be used as a [[Byzantine flags and insignia|symbol of Byzantium]], with [[Virgin Mary]] ([[Queen of Heaven]]) later taking her place, becoming depicted in [[Marian veneration]] on a crescent and adorned with stars. Since then the [[heraldry|heraldric]] use of the star and crescent proliferated, Byzantium's symbolism possibly influencing the development of the [[Ottoman flag]], specifically the combination of the Turkish crescent with a star,<ref>"It seems possible, though not certain, that after the conquest Mehmed took over the crescent ''and'' star as an emblem of sovereignty from the Byzantines. The half-moon alone on a blood red flag, allegedly conferred on the Janissaries by Emir Orhan, was much older, as is demonstrated by numerous references to it dating from before 1453. But since these flags lack the star, which along with the half-moon is to be found on Sassanid and Byzantine municipal coins, it may be regarded as an innovation of Mehmed. It seems certain that in the interior of Asia tribes of Turkish nomads had been using the half-moon alone as an emblem for some time past, but it is equally certain that crescent and star ''together'' are attested only for a much later period. There is good reason to believe that old Turkish and Byzantine traditions were combined in the emblem of Ottoman and, much later, present-day Republican Turkish sovereignty."

Hickman Ed., Ralph Manheim Trans.), ''Mehmed the Conqueror and His Time'', Princeton University Press, 1992, p 108</ref> and becoming a popular [[Symbols of Islam|symbol for Islam]] (as the ''[[wikt:hilal#Noun|hilal]]'' of the [[Islamic calendar]]) and [[Star and crescent#Contemporary use|for a range of nations]].<ref name="Kadoi 2014">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Kadoi |first=Yuka |title=Crescent (symbol of Islam) |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of Islam Online |date=October 1, 2014 |url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/encyclopaedia-of-islam-3/crescent-symbol-of-islam-COM_25588?s.num=27&s.start=20}}</ref>

==== Other associations ====
The features of the Moon, the contrasting brighter highlands and darker maria, have been seen by different cultures [[Lunar pareidolia|forming abstract shapes]]. Such shapes are among others the [[Man in the Moon]] (e.g. [[Coyolxāuhqui]]) or the [[Moon Rabbit]] (e.g. the Chinese [[Tu'er Ye]] or in [[Mythologies of the indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous American mythologies]] the aspect of the [[Maya moon goddess|Mayan Moon goddess]], from which possibly [[Awilix]] is derived, or of [[Metztli]]/[[Tēcciztēcatl]]).<ref name="Collections Search – Museum of Fine Arts, Boston 1987"/>

Occasionally some lunar deities have been also depicted [[Luna (goddess)#Chariot of the Moon|driving a chariot across the sky]], such as the Hindu [[Chandra|Chandra/Soma]], the Greek Artemis, which is associated with Selene, or Luna, Selene's ancient Roman equivalent.

Color and material wise the Moon has been associated in Western [[alchemy]] with [[silver]], while gold is associated with the Sun.<ref name="Abbri 2019 pp. 39–44">{{cite journal |last=Abbri |first=Ferdinando |title=Gold and silver: perfection of metals in medieval and early modern alchemy |journal=Substantia |date=August 30, 2019 |issn=2532-3997 |doi=10.13128/Substantia-603 |pages=39–44 |url=https://riviste.fupress.net/index.php/subs/article/view/603 |access-date=April 8, 2022 |archive-date=June 17, 2022 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20220617041849/https://riviste.fupress.net/index.php/subs/article/view/603 |url-status=live}}</ref>

The perception of the Moon in the [[modern era]] has been informed by [[telescope]]-enabled [[modern astronomy]] and later by [[spaceflight]] which enabled actual human activity at the Moon, particularly the [[Apollo program#Cultural impact|culturally impactful lunar landing]]s.

=== Lunar effect ===
{{main|Lunar effect}}
The lunar effect is an unproven correlation between specific stages of the roughly 29.5-day lunar cycle and behavior and physiological changes in living beings on Earth, including humans. The Moon has long been associated with insanity and irrationality; the words ''lunacy'' and ''[[lunatic]]'' are derived from the Latin name for the Moon, ''Luna''. Philosophers [[Aristotle]] and [[Pliny the Elder]] argued that the full moon induced insanity in susceptible individuals, believing that the brain, which is mostly water, must be affected by the Moon and its power over the tides, but the Moon's gravity is too slight to affect any single person.<ref name="sciam"/> Even today, people who believe in a lunar effect claim that admissions to psychiatric hospitals, traffic accidents, homicides or suicides increase during a full moon,<ref name="sciam"/> but over 37 studies invalidate these claims.<ref name="RottonKelly1985"/>
Lunar cycles have significant impacts on human culture but no solid evidence connects these cycles to human biology.<ref name="FosterRoenneberg2008"/>

{{efn|name=maxval
 |The ''maximum value'' is given based on scaling of the brightness from the value of −12.74 given for an equator to Moon-centre distance of 378&nbsp;000&nbsp;km in the NASA factsheet reference to the minimum Earth–Moon distance given there, after the latter is corrected for Earth's equatorial radius of 6&nbsp;378&nbsp;km, giving 350&nbsp;600&nbsp;km. The ''minimum value'' (for a distant [[new moon]]) is based on a similar scaling using the maximum Earth–Moon distance of 407&nbsp;000&nbsp;km (given in the factsheet) and by calculating the brightness of the [[earthshine]] onto such a new moon. The brightness of the earthshine is {{nowrap|[ Earth [[albedo]] ×}} {{nowrap|([[Earth radius]] /}} Radius of [[Moon's orbit]])<sup>2</sup>&nbsp;] relative to the direct solar illumination that occurs for a full moon. ({{nowrap |Earth albedo {{=}} 0.367}}; {{nowrap |Earth radius {{=}} (polar}} radius&nbsp;× equatorial {{nowrap |radius)<sup>½</sup> {{=}} 6 367 km}}.)

{{efn |name=angular size
 |The range of angular size values given are based on simple scaling of the following values given in the fact sheet reference: at an Earth-equator to Moon-centre distance of 378&nbsp;000&nbsp;km, the [[angular size]] is 1896&nbsp;[[arcsecond]]s. The same fact sheet gives extreme Earth–Moon distances of 407&nbsp;000&nbsp;km and 357&nbsp;000&nbsp;km. For the maximum angular size, the minimum distance has to be corrected for Earth's equatorial radius of 6&nbsp;378&nbsp;km, giving 350&nbsp;600&nbsp;km.

{{efn|name=pressure explanation
 |Lucey et al. (2006) give {{nowrap |10<sup>7</sup> particles cm<sup>−3</sup>}} by day and {{nowrap |10<sup>5</sup> particles cm<sup>−3</sup>}} by night. Along with equatorial surface temperatures of 390&nbsp;[[Kelvin|K]] by day and 100&nbsp;K by night, the [[ideal gas law]] yields the pressures given in the infobox (rounded to the nearest [[order of magnitude]]): 10<sup>−7</sup>&nbsp;[[Pascal (unit)|Pa]] by day and 10<sup>−10</sup>&nbsp;Pa by night.

{{efn |name=near-Earth asteroids
 |There are a number of [[near-Earth asteroid]]s, including [[3753 Cruithne]], that are [[co-orbital]] with Earth: their orbits bring them close to Earth for periods of time but then alter in the long term (Morais et al, 2002).
